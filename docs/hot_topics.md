## GPT-4

GPT-4(@openai2023gpt4) is the next LLM in OpenAI's GPT series. It improves upon GPT-3 in a number of ways, including better reasoning and longer context length. Currently, we do not directly cover it in this course since 1) not everyone has access to it yet and 2) most of the prompting strategies we cover in this website work for GPT-4 as well. We encourage you to read the [OpenAI page](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) on GPT-4 for more details.

### Auto-GPT
Imagine having a personal assistant that can do anything you want with the power of AI. Auto-GPT is that, an open-source application that uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 to perform autonomous tasks. Created by Toran Bruce Richards, it works by breaking down a given goal into sub-tasks and then using the internet and other tools to complete those sub-tasks. For example, if you ask Auto-GPT to ''write a blog post about the latest news in artificial intelligence,‚Äù it will first find the latest news articles about artificial intelligence, read them, and then write a blog post about what it learned. To use Auto-GPT, you need to follow the setup instructions (here)[https://significant-gravitas.github.io/Auto-GPT/setup/]. Once you have installed Auto-GPT, you can start using it by typing a goal into the prompt bar. Auto-GPT will then try to achieve that goal.
